God-Entity
----------

Charlotte is a human God-Entity, who holds functional omnipotence over a section of the universe.
However, she is still human, which means she experiences linear time and human emotions
(to some degree)


Route 1 (Sussex):
-----------------

 Narrator switches from "You" to "I" when Char is around, to signify that when she is close the main
 character becomes real again.
