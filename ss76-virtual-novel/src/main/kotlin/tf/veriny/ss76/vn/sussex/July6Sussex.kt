/*
Dear Occupant,

Going out when time doesn't flow is risky. You are lucky that it's only the beginning of this new cycle.

Us maids see a lot that we're not meant to. You're in danger.

Please meet me in the dusty room at midday. Don't let anyone follow you, and don't trust either of what they say.

Dear resident

It is dangerous to go out when the river does not flow. You are lucky you are at the beginning of the cycle.

Maids look a lot about what we do not mean. You are at risk.

Please meet me in a dusty room at noon. Someone should not follow you, and do not trust either of what they say.

Observer
